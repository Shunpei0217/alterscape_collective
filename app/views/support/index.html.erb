          <p>What we value most about our work is our contribution to health organisations and charities. As an NGO, we aren’t in this for the money, we are only interested in making positive changes within the community by improving health standards, first aid and most importantly, the well being of everyone.</p>
          <p>Every contribution, be it small or large, will go towards our selected charities. Bottom line: we want the lives of those who are suffering with an underlying neurological illness to live healthily and happily.</p>

        <h2>Being better</h2>
        <p>Human existence is a mysterious one, and perhaps something we will never come to truly know. As advanced as medical technology is today, we still don’t fully understand these conditions. With no education being put in place to teach the public about these conditions either, we hope our efforts could make a great difference between saving or losing a life.</p>
        <p>For that reason our work is not only experiential, but educational in teaching others the triggers of brain abnormalities and how to react in an emergency situation.</p>
